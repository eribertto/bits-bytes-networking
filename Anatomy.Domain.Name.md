Any given domain name has
three primary parts, and they all serve specific purposes. Let's take the domain name www.google.com,
the three part here should be pretty easy to spot since they're each
set off from each other by a period. They're www, google, and com, the last part of a domain name is
known as the TLD or Top Level Domain. In this case it's the .com
portion of the domain name. There are only a certain restricted
number of defined TLDs available, although that number has been
growing a lot in recent years. The most common TLDs are ones you're
probably already familiar with .com, .net, .edu and so on. You've probably also seen some
country specific TLDs such as .de for Germany or .cn for China. Due to the growth of the Internet, many of the TLDs originally
defined have become very crowded. So today,
a number of vanity TLDs are available, everything from .museum to .pizza. Administration and definition of
TLDs is handled by a non-profit organization known as ICANN, or
the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers and
I can tell you what they do. ICANN is a sister organization to the
IANA, and together they help define and control both the global IP spaces,
along with the global DNS system. A domain is the name commonly used to
refer to the second part of a domain name, which would be, google in our example. Domains are used to demarcate where
control moves from a TLD name server, to an authoritative name server. This is typically under the control
of an independent organization, or someone outside of ICANN. Domains can be registered and
chosen by any individual or company, but they must all end
in one of the predefined TLEs. That www portion of this
is known as the subdomain, sometimes referred to as a host name
if it's been assigned to only one host. When you combine all these parts together, you have what's known as a fully
qualified domain name, or FQDN. While it costs money to officially
register a domain with a registrar, subdomains can be freely chosen and assigned by anyone who controls
such a registered domain. A registrar is just a company that has an agreement with ICANN
to sell unregistered domain names. We'll talk more about dealing with
registrars in a future module. Technically you can have
lots of subdomain names, for example host.sub.sub.subdomain.domain.com
can be completely valid. Although you rarely see fully qualified
domain names with that many levels. DNS can technically
support up to 127 levels of domain in total for
a single fully qualified domain name. There are some other restrictions in place
for how your domain name can be specified. Each individual section can
only be 63 characters long and a complete FQDN is limited
to a total of 255 characters
