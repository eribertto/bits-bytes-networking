Welcome back.
As you've seen, computer networking can be
an incredibly complicated business. There are so many layers,
protocols, and devices at play, and sometimes this means that things
just don't work properly. No surprise there. Many of the protocols and devices we've
covered have built in functionalities to help protect against some of these issues. These functionalities are known as
error detection and error recovery. Error detection is the ability for
a protocol or program to determine that
something went wrong. Error recovery is the ability for a
protocol or program to attempt to fix it. For example, you might remember that cyclical
redundancy checks are used by multiple layers to make sure that the correct
data was received by the receiving end. If a CRC value doesn't match the data
payload, the data is discarded. At that point, the transport layer will
decide if the data needs to be reset. But even with all of these safeguards
in place, errors still pop up. Misconfigurations occur,
hardware breaks down, and system incompatibilities
it comes to light. In this module you'll learn about
the most common techniques and tools you use as an IT support specialist
when troubleshooting network issues. By the end of this module you'll be able
to detect an fix a lot of the common network connectivity problems by using
tools available on the three most common operating systems,
Microsoft Windows, Mac OS and Linux. And finally, at the end of this
module will cover some concepts that are super important to the future
of networking the cloud and IPv6.
