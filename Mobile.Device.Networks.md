Mobile devices use
wireless networks to communicate with the Internet
and with other devices. Depending on the device, it might use cellular
networks, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth and or one
of several Internet of Things or IoT
network protocols. As an IT Support Specialist, you'll often have to
help troubleshoot networking or connectivity
issues for end users. You'll need to figure out what network the device
should be connecting to, and then make sure the device
is configured to do that. For example, turning
individual components and systems on and off is a common
feature in mobile devices, which can sometimes be
confusing for the end users. Battery life is precious, and people switch off
these network radios to save battery life. If someone brings a device to you because it won't connect
to a wireless network, the first thing you
should check is whether the wireless radio
has been disabled. Yeah, sometimes the solution
is really that simple. You can toggle the
Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, and cellular networks on or
off in the device's settings. Lots of mobile devices
will also have an Airplane Mode that disables all wireless networking at once. It is also pretty common
for a mobile device to have multiple network connections
at the same time. Both Wi-Fi and cellular
data for example. Mobile devices will try to
connect to the Internet using the most reliable and least expensive
connection available. That's right. I said
at least expensive. Many mobile operating systems understand the concept
of metered connections. Does your cell phone
plan have a limit on how much data you
can use in a month? Or charge you based on
how much data you use? Then you have a
metered connection through that cell phone plan. Mobile devices will use other non-metered
connections like Wi-Fi, if they're available,
so that you don't use up your limited
data connection. Here's another example
of how you might help as an IT Support Specialist. Let's say you have a
remote employee that works from a coffee
shop sometimes, but the Wi-Fi network
in the coffee shop restricts access
to some websites. The employee might choose to disconnect from
the Wi-Fi network, and use the cell network, even though it might
be more expensive so that they can access
the websites they need. By toggling the Wi-Fi and
cellular data connections, you can force the device to use the network connection
that you want to use. If you're troubleshooting an unreliable wireless
network connection, keep in mind that wireless
networking works by sending a radio signal
between two antennas. What, you don't see an antenna? Well surprise, your
device has one. It might be printed
on a circuit board, or it might have a wire or ribbon that runs
through your device. The radio signal will get weaker the farther it has to travel, especially if it
passes through or reflects off of things
between the two antennas. Mobile devices can go with
you to places where there is too much distance or interference for the wireless
signal to be reliable. Even the way the mobile
device is held or worn can impact the
strength of the signal. So Wi-Fi and cellular
data networks are used to connect your mobile
devices to the internet. But there's one other type of wireless network to talk about. Mobile devices connect to their peripherals using
short-range wireless networks. The most common short
range wireless network is called Bluetooth. You might have used
Bluetooth headphones, keyboards, or mice before. When you connect a
wireless peripheral to a mobile device, we call that pairing the devices. The two devices
exchange information, sometimes including
a PIN or password, so that they can
remember each other. From then on, the devices will automatically
connect to each other when they're both
powered on and in range. Pairing devices like
this can sometimes fail, and you might need to make your device forget
the peripheral, so it can be paired again. Check out the next
supplemental reading to see how to do this in
iOS and Android. Remember, Bluetooth can be
turned off very easily. When you're troubleshooting
a Bluetooth peripheral, always make sure that
Bluetooth is on.
