Supplemental Reading for Broadband Protocols Internet connections used to
require very careful setup, configuration and monitoring. Today, an Internet
connection is mostly a working service provided by an ISP that doesn’t require
much maintenance by those that use it. So it’s unlikely that you’ll actually
have to troubleshoot or diagnose anything to do with the protocols that help
broadband, or even dial-up connections, work.

But, in case you want to learn more about these protocols, the two primary ones
are PPP, or Point-to-Point Protocol (IETF RFC1661), and PPPoE, or Point-to-Point
Protocol over Ethernet (IETF Informational RFC2516). They’re both data link
layer protocols.
