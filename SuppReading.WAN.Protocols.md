Supplemental Reading for WAN Protocols Unless you end up working as a network
engineer at an Internet service provider, chances are you’ll never have to
directly interact with any of the protocols that allow for WAN technologies to
work. But, if you’d like to learn more about some of the more popular options,
you can read about them on Wikipedia. It’s important to note that these
protocols usually define how both the physical and data link layers need to
operate when they’re deployed.

Check out Frame Relay: here, HDLC, or High-Level Data Link Control: here and
ATM, or Asynchronous Transfer Mode: here.

Heads up: A big part of being successful in an IT role is the ability to be a
self-led learner -- someone who finds key resources and reads up on the latest
tech trends and solutions. The supplemental readings we’ve provided have been
designed to show you just some of the support materials available to you online;
they’re not meant to be considered a comprehensive list. Feel free to add to the
conversation by posting other useful resources for learners to this forum
thread.
