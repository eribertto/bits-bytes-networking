Supplemental Readings for Mobile Device Networks
Internet of Things Protocols
Some mobile devices are what we call Internet of Things (IoT) devices. These devices communicate with each other using Wi-Fi, and/or IoT network protocols. Some of these IoT network protocols areZ-Wave, ZigBee, and Thread. If you work with IoT devices, you will need to understand what network protocols they support, and how they communicate with one another.

Bluetooth Pairing
Mobile devices connect to their peripherals using short-range wireless networks. The most common short range wireless network is called Bluetooth. You might have used Bluetooth headphones, keyboards, or mice before. When you connect a wireless peripheral to a mobile device, we call that pairing the devices. The two devices exchange information, sometimes including a PIN or password, so that they can remember each other. From then on, the devices will automatically connect to each other when they're both powered on and in range. Pairing devices like this can sometimes fail, and you might need to make your device forget the peripheral, so it can be paired again. Check out these articles to see how to do this in iOS and Android.
